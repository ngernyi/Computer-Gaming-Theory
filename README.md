# Computer Gaming Theory: MCTS and IDA* 

## Description
This repository contains implementations of two search algorithms used in game theory:
- **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**: A heuristic search algorithm used for decision-making in games.
- **IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*)**: A search algorithm used to find the optimal path in problems that can be represented by a tree.

## **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**
This algorithm is implemented for the EinStein w√ºrfelt nicht! (EWN) game with deterministic rules.

## **IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*)**
This algorithm is implemented for a path finding game. Some heuristics functions are included to make this algorithm more efficient including chebyshev distance and unusable dice count

## **Acknowledgements**
Some parts of the code were provided by the **Teaching Assistant (TA) and Lecturer** as part of the course materials for **Computer Gaming Theory**. Specifically:
- The **game environment and base framework** for the MCTS implementation were provided.
- The **initial board representation** for IDA* were given as part of the assignment materials.

The rest of the implementation, including enhancements and heuristic optimizations, was developed independently.
